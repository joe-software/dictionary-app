# Dictionary App

This app allows a user to search for a word/term and the app provides relevant information. It includes a dark mode and a font selector. 

## Tech used

This app uses React.JS and HTML/CSS. it also uses Styled-Components to manage CSS/styling.

## Lessons Learned

During this project it became clear that it was easy to creat too many components when using React, when it could be done in a single component, especially in a small project. This meant that there was more complexity when passing props and state than was perhaps necessary.
