# Dictionary App

This app allows a user to search for a word/term and the app provides relevant information. It includes a dark mode and a font selector.

## Tech used

This app uses React.JS and HTML/CSS. it also uses Styled-Components to manage CSS/styling.

## Lessons Learned

During this project it became clear that it was easy to creat too many components when using React, when it could be done in a single component, especially in a small project. This meant that there was more complexity when passing props and state than was perhaps necessary.  

### Executing program

To view a demo:

To run the code:
'npm install'
'npm start'

## Optimizations

If I had more time to further develop this product I would include a method of authentication and allow users to save words which they might want to reference in the future. Additionally, I would use a dropdown menu for the font selector, to keep the interface cleaner.
